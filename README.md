# IDS706_Individual_Project_-2

This repository is for the IDS706 Individual Project #2, and the repository is built on previous one using Python for basic SQL queries.

![CI](https://github.com/therealzella/IDS706-python-github-template/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

## Features
- **SQLite Database Integration**: Supports CRUD operations.
- **Optimized Binary**: The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow to build and upload an optimized Rust binary.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD workflow to test, build, and upload artifacts.
- **Video Demo**: [Link to Video Demo](https://youtu.be/ggfInyxQE-4) 

## LLM Utilization
I utilized an LLM (Language Learning Model) to assist with various stages of the project, including:

- **Code Generation and Syntax Guidance**: The LLM helped with generating initial code structure in Rust, particularly as I'm relatively new to the language. It provided suggestions on Rust-specific syntax and the correct usage of libraries like `rusqlite` for database operations.
  
- **Debugging**: During debugging, the LLM was used to identify common errors and provide insights into fixing issues related to database handling and optimizing performance.

- **Optimization**: For improving the performance of my code, the LLM suggested strategies to efficiently use Rustâ€™s memory and processing capabilities. This led to cleaner and more efficient code, ultimately contributing to the optimized binary build.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/therealzella/IDS706_Individual_Project_-2.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd IDS706_Individual_Project_-2
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    make install

    ```
